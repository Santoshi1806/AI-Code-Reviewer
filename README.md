🚀Excited to share my latest project: AI-Code-Reviewer!🚀



🤖I built an AI Code Reviewer using Python and Streamlit, integrating GoogleAI API to analyze code and provide insightful feedback. The objective of this project is to develop a Python application that allows users to submit their Python code for review and receive feedback on potential bugs along with suggestions for fixes. This application is user-friendly, efficient, and provides accurate bug reports and fixes code snippets. This project is a part of my January 2025-Data Science with Generative AI internship at Innomatics Research Labs.💡



✨ Key Features :

🤖 AI-Powered Code Review: Utilizes Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model for advanced Python code analysis.

🐞 Bug Detection & Fixes: Identifies issues in the submitted code and provides corrected versions

♦️Enhances code quality and efficiency

📚 Explanations: Offers clear explanations for detected errors and suggested fixes.
